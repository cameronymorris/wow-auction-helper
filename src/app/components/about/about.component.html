			WAH is (when it's done) created with the purpose, of 
			helping me make gold in World of Warcraft. The application 
			is going to show a user, how much gold it costs them to craft 
			a spesific item. There will also be some functionality, allowing
			the user to only show profitable items and compare them to the 
			current lowest buyout. There might also be something to
			help with finding items beneath a certain threashold.
