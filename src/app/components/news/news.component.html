					New functionality have been added since your last visit, among them youl'l find the following:
				</p>

				<h5 class="list-group-item-heading"><strong>Watchlist</strong></h5>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-group-item-text">
						Allows you to add items with an alert value. If the item is found below or equal that value
						 you will recieve a push notification, showing how many items meet your criteria.
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item-text">
						If you have a recipe for an item, the crafting cost will be visible also, and you will
						get notifications if the item has more than 10% potential profit.
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item-text">
						By default, youl'l get a pre-defined list.
						Feel free to make it your own!; edit the groups, remove groups add items etc.
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item-text">
						When deleting a group you can move it's items to another
						group or delete the items and group.
					</li>
					<li class="list-group-item-text">
						Keep in mind, that you need to have the webapp open for notifications to work.
						You do not need to have it in the foreground/focus however.
						You can play a game, or do something else while the app will notify you in the background!
					</li>
