# WoW Auction Helper Online
This is a hobby project created, with the intention of finding profitable items to craft in World of Warcraft. If you wish to try to use it, it's live @ http://wah.jonaskf.net

The application uses localStorage and indexedDB to store user settings and data locally, rather than storing anything in a database. It also uses the "HashbangStrategy" for urls.

## Technology
The application uses the following:
- Angular 2 with TypeScript for the front-end
- Bootstrap for the majority of the style
- MySQL & Php for the backend API for storing all recipe and item data in one place.

## Supported platforms
The webapp is created with an intention of using new technologies, and thus may not support older browsers.

## Usage
To get started with the project, you need to have nodejs, npm and angular-cli installed.
- You can download nodejs (with npm) here: https://nodejs.org/en/
- You can install angular-cli in the terminal or command prompt with the following command: npm install -g angular-cli
